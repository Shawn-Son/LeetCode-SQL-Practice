# 2362. Generate the Invoice

## ðŸ“˜ Problem

You are given two tables:

### `Products`
| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| product_id  | int  |
| price       | int  |

- `product_id` is unique.  
- Each row stores the unit price of a product.

### `Purchases`
| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| invoice_id  | int  |
| product_id  | int  |
| quantity    | int  |

- `(invoice_id, product_id)` is the primary key.  
- Each row stores the quantity of a product in a specific invoice.

**Task:**  
Return the **details (line items)** of the invoice with the **highest total price**.  
If multiple invoices tie for the highest total, return the one with the **smallest `invoice_id`**.  
Output columns: `product_id`, `quantity`, `price` where `price = quantity * unit_price`.  
Return rows in any order.
