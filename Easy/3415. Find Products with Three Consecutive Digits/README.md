# LeetCode 3415. Find Products with Three Consecutive Digits

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
You are given a table `Products` containing product IDs and names.

### **Table: Products**
| Column Name | Type    | Description |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| product_id  | int     | Unique identifier for each product |
| name        | varchar | Name of the product |

`product_id` is the **primary key**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Find all products whose `name` contains a sequence of **exactly three consecutive digits** in a row.

**Rules:**
- The sequence must be **exactly 3 digits** (e.g., `123`, `003`, `789`).
- Ignore products with no such sequence.
- If the name contains multiple sequences, it still qualifies.
- Return the result ordered by `product_id` in ascending order.
